##### Project Euler, Problem 15

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

## The Permutation "Solution"


This problem states that the only two directions we can travel, starting from the origin, are *right* and *down*. If we were to transcribe the traversal in plain english, the six paths that we can travel in a 2 x 2 grid are as follows:


 * Right, Right, Down, Down
 * Right, Down, Right, Down
 * Right, Down, Down, Right
 * Down, Right, Right, Down
 * Down, Right, Down, Right
 * Down, Down, Right, Right


There are a few observations we can make about the transcribed lists above:

* Every list has $2$ right turns.
* Every list has $2$ down turns.
* Every list has $2+2$ items total.
* No two lists are repeated exactly. The primary difference between them is the order in which the turns appear.


We can generalize our observations to state: "To determine the number of paths in any $g\times g$ grid, we need only to find the number of **distinct permutations** of a list that  contains $g$ right turns, contains $g$ down turns, and has a total of $2g$ items."

The intuition behind the algorithm I used to find all of the permutations can be <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/next-lexicographical-permutation-algorithm" target="_blank">found here</a>. In fact, the function I use in this "solution" named ```nextPermutation``` is borrowed from the same source.

In the "solution" below, we are manually constructing an array of "rights" and "downs." Than we are manually permuting the list in lexicographical order while we increment a counter. After we run through all distinct permutations, the counter is then logged to the console.

DISCLAIMER: You may have noticed that I've been wrapping the word "solution" in quotation marks. That is because the code below will theoretically generate the correct answer if allowed to run for an impossibly long time. You can confirm that the *idea* behind the "solution" is correct by changing the ```gridSize``` variable, which represents $g$, to 4. In so doing, the code will log ```70``` to the console, which is the correct answer. Feel free to play around with that variable until you can absolve my reasoning.

```javascript
const gridSize = 20;
const route = [];
let count = 0;

/**
 * Permutes array in lexicographical order.
 * @param {number[]}
 * @returns {boolean} If false, no other permutations remain.
 * @author Project Nayuki
 * @see https://www.nayuki.io/page/next-lexicographical-permutation-algorithm
 */
function nextPermutation(array) {
 // Find non-increasing suffix
 var i = array.length - 1;
 while (i > 0 && array[i - 1] >= array[i])
  i--;
 if (i <= 0)
  return false;
 
 // Find successor to pivot
 var j = array.length - 1;
 while (array[j] <= array[i - 1])
  j--;
 var temp = array[i - 1];
 array[i - 1] = array[j];
 array[j] = temp;
 
 // Reverse suffix
 j = array.length - 1;
 while (i < j) {
  temp = array[i];
  array[i] = array[j];
  array[j] = temp;
  i++;
  j--;
 }
 return true;
}

for (let i = 0; i < gridSize; i += 1) {
  route.push(0); // 0 represents "right."
}

for (let i = 0; i < gridSize; i += 1) {
  route.push(1); // 1 represents "down."
}

count += 1;

while(nextPermutation(route)) {
  count += 1;
}

console.log(count);
```

It should be clear to everyone, by running the code above, that the permutation approach is not the correct answer. There is, however, a way to solve this problem by analyzing it mathematically.

## The Combination Math Solution

If we start to think in terms of 'combination' instead of 'permutation', a mathematical solution opens itself to us. The following (binomial coefficient) equation can help us:

##### $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

The intuition behind the equation can be gleamed here:

Let's think again, about the transcribed list of routes of a 2 x 2 grid (in the previous section).

If we began with an empty list with 4 empty slots: *(empty)*, *(empty)*, *(empty)*, *(empty)*

Let's ask ourselves, "How many ways can we insert 2 right turns into such a list?" The answer happens to be 6. You can insert them in the following ways:


 * Right, Right, *(empty)*, *(empty)*
 * Right, *(empty)*, Right, *(empty)*
 * Right, *(empty)*, *(empty)*, Right
 * *(empty)*, Right, Right, *(empty)*
 * *(empty)*, Right, *(empty)*, Right
 * *(empty)*, *(empty)*, Right, Right


Notice how this looks a lot like the lists in the previous section.  We can omit the down turns and still arrive at the correct answer because we can assume the remaining empty slots represent down turns. This means we need to choose 2 slots out of 4 possible options; in other words, $k = 2$ and $n = 4$. Let's apply our understanding to the binomial coefficient equation: 

##### $$\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{2\cdot 1\cdot (2\cdot 1)} = \frac{\not 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{\not 4} = 6$$

We can generalize this example to assume that $k = g$ and $n = 2g$. We should also process the binomial coefficient equation in such a way that it can be coded efficiently. We can use the Multiplicative formula (Note: The $\underline{k}$ exponent in the numerator of the first expression is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_and_rising_factorials" target="_blank">falling factorial</a>):

##### $$\binom {n}{k} = \frac{n^{\underline{k}}}{k!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-(k-1))}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}=\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{n+1-i}{i}$$

I have implemented the above equation in my solution below and it will work well for our purposes. Though it's worth mentioning that my solution can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Binomial_coefficient_in_programming_languages" target="_blank">optimized upon</a> when trying to calculate very large numbers.

```javascript
const gridSize = 20;

function choose(n, k){
  let product = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= k; i += 1) {
    product *= (n + 1 - i) / i;
  }
  return product;
}

console.log(choose(2 * gridSize, gridSize));
```
