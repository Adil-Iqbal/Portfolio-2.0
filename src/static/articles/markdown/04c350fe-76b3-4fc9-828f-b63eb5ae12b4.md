##### Project Euler, Problem 14

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
* If $n$ is **even**: $n\to n/2$ 
* If $n$ is **odd**: $n\to 3n+1$ 

Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:

##### $$13\to 40\to 20\to 10\to 5\to 16\to 8\to 4\to 2\to 1$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

*NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.*

## The Naive Approach

The first thought I had when I read this problem was "This is easy." 

Of course, I could easily use the brute force solution:

```javascript
const limit = 1000000;
let maxChain = 0;
let answer;

function Collatz(num) {
  let count = 0;
  while(num != 1) {
    if (num % 2 === 0) {
      num /= 2;
      count += 1;
    } else {
      num = 3 * num + 1;
      count += 1;
    }
  }
  count += 1;
  return count; 
}

for (let i = 1; i < limit; i++) {
  const chain = Collatz(i);
  if (chain > maxChain) {
    maxChain = chain;
    answer = i;
  }
}

console.log(answer);
```

The second thought I had was: "It can't possibly be this easy..."

The more I stared at the question, the more opportunities I found for optimization.

## The Actual Approach

### Optimization #1: Constraining the Bounds

Let's look at line #20 in the naive approach. Do we really need to search through almost <i>1 million</i> positive integers to find our solution? The Collatz Conjecture states that the Collatz sequence for any positive integer $x$, after some number of steps, will eventually reach $1$. In other words:

##### $$x\to \cdots \to 1$$

Consider for a moment the Collatz sequence for the positive integer $2x$. We know for a fact that $2x$ <i>must</i>, by definition, be even. After all, it can be evenly divided by 2. From the question, we know that the handling of an even number is $n\to n/2$. Since we are assuming $n = 2x$, the Collatz sequence for $2x$ looks like this:

##### $$2x\to x\to \cdots \to 1$$

We can infer from this thought experiment that $\text{Collatz}(2x) = \text{Collatz}(x) + 1$, which means that $\text{Collatz}(2x) > \text{Collatz}(x)$ regardless of the value of $x$.

How does this fact help us? If we assume that our answer is under our <code class="language-javascript">limit</code> variable (on line #1), than the lowest value that our solution could possibly be is <code class="language-javascript">limit / 2</code>, since any value under that has a corresponding $2x$ <i>above</i> <code class="language-javascript">limit / 2</code>.

Here is an example: For this problem, $\text{limit} = 1000000$ and $\text{limit}/2 = 500000$. That means that $\text{Collatz}(300000)$ could not possibly be the answer, because $\text{Collatz}(600000)$ is sure to be greater. It makes no sense for us to bother trying to calculate any number below $\text{limit}/2$.

Therefore, I purpose the following change to line #20:

```diff
@@ -20,1 +20,1 @@
- for (let i = 1; i < limit; i++) {
+ for (let i = Math.floor(limit / 2); i < limit; i++) {
```

### Optimization #2: Double-stepping during Odd Number Handling

Therefore, I purpose we alter lines 12 and 13 like so:

```diff
@@ -12,2 +12,2 @@
-      num = 3 * num + 1;
-      count += 1;
+      num = (3 * num + 1) / 2;
+      count += 2;
```

### Optimization #3: Re-using Past Work

```diff
@@ -1,7 +1,13 @@
+ const _cache = [0, 1];
+
  const limit = 1000000;
  let maxChain = 0;
  let answer;

- function Collatz(num) {
+ function Collatz(num, cache = _cache) {
    let count = 0;
-   while(num != 1) {
+   while(true) {
+     if (cache[num]) {
+       count += cache[num];
+       break;
+     }
```

You may have noticed that at no point during the above diff do I actually cache the Collatz length of the ```num``` parameter.  I could've added a one-liner statement just before I returned the ```count``` variable; something like: ```cache[num] = count;``` 

Unfortunately, for such a change to be effective, I would have to leave the bounds unconstrained (see Optimization #1). Luckily, I have one more trick up my sleeve.
